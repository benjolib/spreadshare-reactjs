								Weâ€™re focusing on iterating our product based on the learnings from our most recent release.
								Weâ€™ll be starting by letting selected users access our platform.
								Together with them weâ€™ll explore the way they use the product and define a roadmap to iterate it.
								Thereâ€™s more features to come, bugs to fix, new ideas to design and content to be added.
								ðŸš¨ Interested to have a look on our code and explore ways to collaborate?
								Just send us a mail to <a href="mailto:hi@spreadshare.co">hi@spreadshare.co</a>

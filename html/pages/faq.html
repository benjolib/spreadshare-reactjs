  <li>Sheets can’t be monetised</li>
  <li>Sheets don’t foster real collaboration</li>
  <li>Sheets don’t acknowledge the creators</li>
  <li>Sheets can’t be searched or discovered.</li>
  <li>Sheets can’t be rated or reviewed.</li>
  <li>Sheets don’t like to be searched / indexed.</li>
  <li>Sheets are not linking to, interacting with each other. Every sheet behaves like an own platform, there are no intersections, connections to other sheets.</li>
  <li>Sheets don’t offer a clean visual experience</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>TOKEN</h3>
  </br>
  <h4>Where does the value come from?</h4>
  <p>At its root, SpreadShare is simply a points system. However, because this points system is blockchain-based, the points can be traded on markets as tokens. People buy and sell these tokens, and many hold in anticipation of increased purchasing power for various SpreadShare-related services.</p>

  <h4>Why are people getting vastly different rewards?</h4>
  <p>The amount of tokens a creator or contributor receives are determined by the quality of their creations. The number of visitors and upvotes a table receives determines the token amount distributed.</p>

  <h4>Where do the tokens come from?</h4>
  <p>The SpreadShare platform continually creates digital tokens to reward content creators.</p>

  <h4>How can I earn token?</h4>
  <p>You can earn digital token on SpreadShare by enriching our community with valuable content, inviting new members and spreading the word.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Creating a new table (2,5% of all token generated by this table): Create a table and earn 2.5% of all tokens the table generates (for all time). As more users view and upvote the table as more tokens are generated every day.</li>
  <li>Contributing to a table (%-share of all token generated by this table): By contributing to a table you own a certain stake of the content. The amount of tokens a contributor receives depends on the number of upvotes and views a tables receives during a day.</li>
  <li>Inviting new members (10 token): You can invite new members by email or via a invite-link. Once they have signed up, you receive 10 tokens. There is no limit of how many members you can invite.</li>
  <li>Importing contacts (5 token): Import your contacts from Google, Twitter or Facebook and earn 5 token for each import.</li>
  <li>Spreading the word (5 token): Proof your social accounts and spread the word to verify your identity and spread the word. We support Facebook, Twitter, Product Hunt, Hackeer News, Medium, LinkedIn and Github.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>What can I do with token?</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Hold them as a stable-value token</li>
  <li>Purchase items on our platform (coming soon)</li>
  <li>Convert to SPRD via your wallet  (coming soon)</li>
  <li>Exchange for SPRD in the internal market  (coming soon)</li>
  <li>Withdraw to an exchange, and trade for BTC or other digital tokens  (coming soon)</li>
  <li>Purchase items through third-party stores that accept SBD tokens  (coming soon)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>What is SPRD?</h4>
  <p>SPRD is the name for the system’s value token (coming soon).</p>

  <h4>Where do the new SPRD tokens come from?</h4>
  <p>Blockchains like SpreadShare and Bitcoin produce new tokens each time a block is produced. Unlike Bitcoin, where all of the new coins go to the block producers (called miners), the SpreadShare blockchain allocates a majority of the new tokens to a reward fund, the “Honeypot”. The Honeypot gives users tokens for participating in the platform</p>

  <h4>What is the Honeypot?</h4>
  <p>Every day, a variable amount of SPRD tokens are allocated to the platform reward fund, commonly called the "Honeypot". These get distributed to users for creating tables, contributing to them and inviting new users.</p>


  <h4>How many token do I receive every day?</h4>
  <p>It depends of the number of tables you have created and contributed to. And on the other activities you’ve done to receive token (inviting user, spreading the word).</p>
  <ul>
   <li>If you have created a table you’ll receive 2,5% of all token generated by this table (for all time). As more users view and upvote the table as more tokens you receive.</li>
   <li>If you have contributed to a table you’ll receive a percentage of the tokens generated by this table.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>How many token does a table receive each day?</h4>
  <p>The amount of token a table receives per day is determined by the number of upvotes and views it receives.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>1 Upvote = 1 token</li>
  <li>1 View = 0,01 token</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>How are the new tokens distributed?</h4>
  <p>Out of the new tokens that are generated every day:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>10% go to platform as a vault</li>
   <li>90% go to the users for contributing</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>When do I receive my tokens?</h4>
  <p>We are distributing tokens every day, the exact time depends on the time zone you’re living in. Our distribution happens every day at 11:59pm Pacific Time.</p>

  <h4> What determines the price of SPRD? </h4>
  <p>Coming soon.</p>

  <h4>What is a blockchain?</h4>
  <p>A blockchain is a public ledger of all transactions ever executed. All of the transactions and data are stored in a distributed database. Each time the database is updated, all of updates are done together in a batch called a 'block'. Each time a new block is produced/added, it is appended on to all of the previous blocks - hence the name "blockchain".</p>

  <h4>What is the SpreadShare blockchain?</h4>
  <p>The SpreadShare blockchain is the publicly accessible distributed database, which records all tables, views and votes, and distributes the rewards across the network of contributors. It is where all of the table content, voting and other data is stored, and it is where all of the reward calculations and payouts are performed.</p>

  <h4>Can I mine SPRD?</h4>
  <p>No, mining is no and won’t be an option on SpreadShare.</p>

  <h4>How do I transfer my SPRD into savings?</h4>
  <p>Coming soon.</p>

  <h4>What information is shown in my wallet?</h4>
  <p>The wallet shows the total amount of tokens you’ve received as well as an overview per table.</p>

  <p>SpreadShare is an online open-content collaborative platform; that is, a voluntary association of individuals and groups working to develop a common resource of human knowledge. The structure of the project allows anyone with an Internet connection to alter its content. Please be advised that nothing found here has necessarily been reviewed by people with the expertise required to provide you with complete, accurate or reliable information.</p>
  <p>That is not to say that you will not find valuable and accurate information in SpreadShare; much of the time you will. However, SpreadShare cannot guarantee the validity of the information found here. The content of any given table may recently have been changed, vandalized or altered by someone whose opinion does not correspond with the state of knowledge in the relevant fields. Note that most other platforms and reference works also have disclaimers.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>No formal peer review</h3>
  <p>Our active community of editors uses tools such as the Special:Recentchanges and Special:Newpages feeds to monitor new and changing content. However, SpreadShare is not uniformly peer reviewed; while readers may correct errors or engage in casual peer review, they have no legal duty to do so and thus all information read here is without any implied warranty of fitness for any purpose or use whatsoever. Even tables that have been vetted by informal peer review or featured table processes may later have been edited inappropriately, just before you view them.</p>
  <p>None of the contributors, sponsors, administrators or anyone else connected with SpreadShare in any way whatsoever can be responsible for the appearance of any inaccurate or libelous information or for your use of the information contained in or linked from these web pages.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="__page__container">

  <div class="__page__wrapper">

  <p>PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES (DEFINED BELOW) ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.<p>

  <h3>Effective November 30, 2017</h3>
  <p>Welcome to SpreadShare. Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services and applications (the “Services”). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at hi@SpreadShare.co or Schönholtzer Str. 10A, 10115 Berlin.</p>
  <p>These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and SpreadShare.co (“SpreadShare,” “we” and “us”). You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. Your using the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the  Privacy Policy.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Will these Terms ever change?</h3>
  <p>We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the SpreadShare.co website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.</p>
  <p>If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p>
  <p>Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>What about my privacy?</h3>
  <p>SpreadShare takes the privacy of its users very seriously.</p>
  <p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at hi@SpreadShare.co.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>What are the basics of using SpreadShare?</h3>
  <p>You may be required to sign up for an account, and select a password and user name (“SpreadShare User ID”). You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You may not select as your SpreadShare User ID a name that you don’t have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.</p>
  <p>You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf).</p>
  <p>You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal, non-commercial use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.</p>
  <p>You will not share your account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your account and your password. You’re responsible for any activity associated with your account.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Your use of the Services is subject to the following additional restrictions:</h3>
  <p>You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not contribute any Content or User Submission (each of those terms is defined below) or otherwise use the Services or interact with the Services in a manner that:</p>
  <p>(a) Infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone else (including SpreadShare);</p>
  <p>(b) Violates any law or regulation, including any applicable export control laws;</p>
  <p>(c) Is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable;</p>
  <p>(d) Jeopardizes the security of your SpreadShare account or anyone else’s (such as allowing someone else to log in to the Services as you);</p>
  <p>(e) Attempts, in any manner, to obtain the password, account, or other security information from any other user;</p>
  <p>(f) Violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords or security encryption codes;</p>
  <p>(g) Runs Maillist, Listserv, any form of auto-responder or “spam” on the Services, or any processes that run or are activated while you are not logged into the Services, or that otherwise interfere with the proper working of the Services (including by placing an unreasonable load on the Services’ infrastructure);</p>
  <p>(h) “Crawls,” “scrapes,” or “spiders” any page, data, or portion of or relating to the Services or Content (through use of manual or automated means);</p>
  <p>(i) Copies or stores any significant portion of the Content;</p>
  <p>(j) Decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or information of or relating to the Services.</p>
  <p>A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>What are my rights in SpreadShare?</h3>
  <p>The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions, and so forth (all of the foregoing, the “Content”) are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including SpreadShare’s) rights.</p>
  <p>You understand that SpreadShare owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.</p>
  <p>The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply – they do!</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Do I have to grant any licenses to SpreadShare or to other users?</h3>
  <p>Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your “User Submission.” Some User Submissions are viewable by other users. In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions. Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our Privacy Policy to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.</p>
  <p>For all User Submissions, you hereby grant SpreadShare a license to translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example making sure your content is viewable on an iPhone as well as a computer) and reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below. This is a license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.</p>
  <p>If you store a User Submission in your own personal SpreadShare account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a “Personal User Submission”), you grant SpreadShare the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal User Submission accessible to you and providing the Services necessary to do so.</p>
  <p>If you share a User Submission only in a manner that only certain specified users can view (for example, a private message to one or more other users) (a “Limited Audience User Submission”), then you grant SpreadShare the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Limited Audience User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Limited Audience User Submission accessible to such other specified users, and providing the Services necessary to do so. Also, you grant such other specified users a license to access that Limited Audience User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.</p>
  <p>If you share a User Submission publicly on the Services and/or in a manner that more than just you or certain specified users can view, or if you provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any feedback, suggestions, improvements, enhancements, and/or feature requests relating to the Services] (each of the foregoing, a “Public User Submission”), then you grant SpreadShare the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for the purpose of making that Public User Submission accessible to all SpreadShare users and providing the Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that Public User Submission in connection with the Services and/or otherwise in connection with SpreadShare’s business for any purpose, provided that SpreadShare will try to notify you if it uses your Public User Submission for any reason other than displaying it on the Services. Also, you grant all other users of the Services a license to access that Public User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.</p>
  <p>You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual, sublicenseable, irrevocable, and worldwide, provided that when you delete your SpreadShare account, we will stop displaying your User Submissions (other than Public User Submissions, which may remain fully available)] to other users (if applicable), but you understand and agree that it may not be possible to completely delete that content from SpreadShare’s records, and that your User Submissions may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they were copied or stored by other users.</p>
  <p>Finally, you understand and agree that SpreadShare, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses include the rights to do so.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?</h3>
  <p>You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), as it relates to online service providers, like SpreadShare, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone’s copyright. We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers; to review our complete Copyright Dispute Policy and learn how to report potentially infringing content, click here. To learn more about the DMCA, click here.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?</h3>
  <p>Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.</p>
  <p>You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.</p>
  <p>The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by SpreadShare. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that SpreadShare is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.</p>
  <p>SpreadShare has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, SpreadShare will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site or service. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.</p>
  <p>Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that SpreadShare shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.</p>
  <p>If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that SpreadShare is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release SpreadShare, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor."</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Will SpreadShare ever change the Services?</h3>
  <p>We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Does SpreadShare cost anything?</h3>
  <p>The SpreadShare Services are currently free, but we reserve the right to charge for certain or all Services in the future. We will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>What if I want to stop using SpreadShare?</h3>
  <p>You’re free to do that at any time, by contacting us at hi@SpreadShare.co; please refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services. SpreadShare is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms. SpreadShare has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.</p>
  <p>Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account. We will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important User Submissions you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone’s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of SpreadShare.</p>
  <p>Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.</p>
